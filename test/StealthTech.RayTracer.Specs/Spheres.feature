Feature: Spheres

Scenario: A ray intersects a sphere at two points
	Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
	And s ← sphere()
	When xs ← intersect(s, r)
	Then xs.count = 2
	And xs[0].Time = 4.0
	And xs[1].Time = 6.0

Scenario: A ray intersects a sphere at a tangent
	Given r ← ray(point(0, 1, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
	And s ← sphere()
	When xs ← intersect(s, r)
	Then xs.count = 2
	And xs[0].Time = 5.0
	And xs[1].Time = 5.0

Scenario: A ray misses a sphere
	Given r ← ray(point(0, 2, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
	And s ← sphere()
	When xs ← intersect(s, r)
	Then xs.count = 0

Scenario: A ray originates inside a sphere
	Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, 0), vector(0, 0, 1))
	And s ← sphere()
	When xs ← intersect(s, r)
	Then xs.count = 2
	And xs[0].Time = -1.0
	And xs[1].Time = 1.0

Scenario: A sphere is behind a ray
	Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, 5), vector(0, 0, 1))
	And s ← sphere()
	When xs ← intersect(s, r)
	Then xs.count = 2
	And xs[0].Time = -6.0
	And xs[1].Time = -4.0

Scenario: Intersect sets the object on the intersection
	Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
	And s ← sphere()
	When xs ← intersect(s, r)
	Then xs.count = 2
	And xs[0].Item = s
	And xs[1].Item = s

Scenario: A sphere's default transformation
	Given s ← sphere()
	Then s.transform = identity_matrix

Scenario: Changing a sphere's transformation
	Given s ← sphere()
	And t ← translation(2, 3, 4)
	When set_transform(s, t)
	Then s.transform = t

Scenario: Intersecting a scaled sphere with a ray
	Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
	And s ← sphere()
	When set_transform(s, scaling(2, 2, 2))
	And xs ← intersect(s, r)
	Then xs.count = 2
	And xs[0].Time = 3
	And xs[1].Time = 7

Scenario: Intersecting a translated sphere with a ray
	Given r ← ray(point(0, 0, -5), vector(0, 0, 1))
	And s ← sphere()
	When set_transform(s, translation(5, 0, 0))
	And xs ← intersect(s, r)
	Then xs.count = 0
